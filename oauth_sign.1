.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
OAuth is a three-party authorization protocol described in RFC5849.
.I Oauth_sign
generates a signature header to use when making an OAuth request.
.PP
To use it, you supply the four cryptographic cookies and the method & URL
of the request.
If it's a POST request with extra parameters, you have to give those too.
.I Oauth_sign
puts all this together and makes the signature string.
The signature is generated using HMAC-SHA1 as specified in RFC
section 3.4.2, and is returned as an Authorization header value
as specified in RFC section 3.5.1.
This header can then be used in an HTTP request via, for example,
the -h flag in http_get(1) and http_post(1) or the -H flag in curl(1).
.PP
The signature may also be generated as query parameters, as specified
in RFC section 3.5.3, by using the -q flag.
You can also give the -b flag to write the "signature base string"
to stderr for debugging purposes.
.PP
The signature generation code is also available as a C function, if you
want to link it into your code directly.
.SH "GETTING A TOKEN"
The procedure to get a token and token secret varies from
system to system.
If you are using Twitter, the standard way to get a token and secret
is to run through a multi-step request_token / authorize / callback process.
However if you are the only user of your application, there's
a way to get Twitter's web site to give you a single token
for your app.  Go to http://dev.twitter.com/apps and click on
your app, then click on "My Access Token" over on the right.
